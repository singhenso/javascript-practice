/*
	Graphs are defined as G(V, E) - consisting of two sets (V) and (E)

	V - Set of Vertices or Nodes
	E - Set of Edges or Associations between Nodes

	Two types of graphs:

		Directed - direction for an edge is defined
		Undirected - direction for an edge is not defined

	Also graphs are considered either:

		Simple - no loops
		Non-simple - contains loops
