Parallel vs. Async


Parallelism - At any moment, 30 people can all experience the roller coaster at the same time; this is about optimization

Nonparallelism - At any moment, only 1 person can ride the roller coaster

Operating system schedules threads from core so that it can be as parallel as possible

Javascript runs in a single thread at any given instant in the JS Engine. Web workers is a way of spinning up a seperate thread through the browser, but thats the web platform NOT JavaScript.

Concurrency - 2 higher level tasks happening within the same time frame (not an instant); scheduling micro-level tasks on the event loop so that at any given instant its only doing one of those things at a first come first serve basis (whoever is quickest is scheduled first)

The scheduling of concurrency is not always within our control but there is coordination necessary of responses to things happening
